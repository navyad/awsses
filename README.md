# Build a mock API for AWS SES

1. Document special rules like email warming up (only few mails can be sent in first few weeks, etc)
2. Document error codes and different meanings
3. Plan the behaviour of mock API (it should allow for various scenarios to emerge)
4. Code the API (should match exactly AWS contract)
5. Code the special behaviours required (count of mails received, etc)
6. Any other enhancements you would like to showcase.
